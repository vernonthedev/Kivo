# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.2]. 2026-04-08

### This release introduces Native Auto-Updates.

- **New**: Auto Updater. Kivo now automatically checks for, silently downloads, and prepares updates in the background, minimizing disruptions.
- **New**: Seamless Upgrades. You can now restart and apply updates whenever you are ready via a clean Toast notification or directly from the Collection Settings panel.
- **Security**: Signed Binaries. All updates are now distributed and verified utilizing Tauri's cryptographically secure signatures.

- **Full Changelog**: [View CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/dexter-xD/Kivo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## [0.3.1]. 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Collection Data Loss**. When you edit environment variables it no longer removes requests and subfolders from the collection directory.

- **Requests Not Persisted**. New requests are now correctly saved to disk. Stay there even after you restart the app.

- **Request Not Working**. Deleting a request now properly removes its file from disk.

- **Slash Names Breaking Storage**. Collection and request names with `/` or characters are now safely changed for the filesystem while keeping the original display name.

### Changed

- **Storage Robustness**. All serde structs now use defaults stopping silent deserialization failures from corrupting state.

- **Testability**. Core storage logic is now extracted into functions and covered by 59 unit tests across normal, complex and stress scenarios.
